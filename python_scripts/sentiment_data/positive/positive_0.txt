AMD has gone up 80% since I made it my top tech pick, however, I believe that that's just the beginning.The company is finally competitive with both Intel and Nvidia and stealing market share from both of them.As it increases its market share, AMD is also expanding its margins. Those two things combined will result in rapid profit growth.The AMD of 2020 will have a P/E at the current market average, assuming no growth in share price.I highly recommend investing in AMD at this time. The company's current growth is just the beginning, and the company has lots of room to expand.I believe that AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), one of the largest chip manufacturers on the world, is fundamentally undervalued. As we will see in this article, the company’s increased competitiveness with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in markets experiencing rapid growth, combined with increasing retail growth and the company’s strong financial improvements means that the company still has significant room for growth.On January 2, 2018, I wrote an article titled “AMD - Top Tech Pick For 2018”.

Thanks to a strong year, in just over 8 months, AMD’s stock price has gone up almost 80%.AMD Radeon - AMD WebsiteIntel and Nvidia have a combined market cap of almost $400 billion compared to AMD’s market cap of less than $20 billion. That leaves a lot of room for AMD to grow and capture market share. More so, due to stumbles by both companies, despite their size, it’ll take them many months to get back onto equal footing with AMD.
